# BigData_ImageProcessing
The project merges big data with image/video processing in sports, leveraging HD cameras and AI to enhance strategy, player evaluation, and decision-making. It offers insights into using CNNs and object detection for in-depth sports analysis, showcasing future potentials in sports analytics.

The "Big Data in Image Processing and Video Analysis" project, led by Hema Seshadri, combines big data analysis with image and video processing, focusing on sports.Project explains how data is collected using more than 100 high-definition cameras and various sensors to capture every detail of the games. The project shows how analyzing this data in real-time can change the way sports teams plan their strategies, improve how they evaluate players, and make better tactical decisions.

Furthermore, it acts as a detailed guide on using advanced technology like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), object detection, and action recognition to analyze sports events closely. These technologies provide a new level of understanding of game aspects such as player tracking, ball control, and overall team strategies, giving sports teams an advantage. This analysis helps teams make decisions based on data regarding which players to select and how to improve their game plans. It not only demonstrates the current capabilities of sports analytics but also suggests how big data and image processing can lead to new ways of playing, coaching, and enjoying sports worldwide. It's a valuable tool for anyone interested in technology, sports analysis, or those who are simply enthusiastic about sports.
